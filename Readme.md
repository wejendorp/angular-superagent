# angular-superagent

  Angular wrapper for [Superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent).

  Written because the [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular) api never made sense to me,
  and superagent has a nicer api than [$http](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http) or jQuery.

## Installation

  Install with [component(1)](http://component.io):

    $ component install wejendorp/angular-superagent

    $ bower install angular-superagent
    
    //Then register the provider witth
    var app = angular.module('app', ['ngSuperagent']);

## API
The `Request` service works just like [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent),
except extended with promises and defaults via `RequestProvider.defaults`.

The request can be written as default superagent, e.g.
```js
app.controller('AppCtrl', function(Request) {
  Request.get('/data')
    .query({page: 1})
    .promise();
})
```

### request#promise()
Like `request#end`, but returns a promise instead of taking a callback.
Returns a [$q](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$q) promise, that is resolved with the superagent response object.

### request#end(fn)
The classic superagent request end, but with configured defaults


## Configure: RequestProvider
### defaults
To set new defaults just override the options here:
```js
RequestProvider.defaults = {
  baseUrl: '',
  headers: {},
  credentials: true,
  timeout: 10000
};
```

### #addResolver(success, error)
Extends the promise chain returned from `request#promise()`,
useful for conditional transformations.

`success` and `error` are executed with `this` bound to expose `this.reject` and `this.resolve`
functions, enabling each promise to either resolve or reject itself.
